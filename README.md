# Student Analysis Project

This is my first data analysis project where I explored the relationship between students’ study habits, age, extra credit, and marks using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. The goal of this project is to understand patterns in student performance and visualize data in meaningful ways.

## Project Overview
- Created a dataset of 10 students with attributes: Age, Gender, Hours Studied, Marks, Extra Credit, and Sports Participation.
- Explored relationships between numeric columns using scatter plots, regression plots, pair plots, and joint plots.
- Analyzed distributions with histograms and KDE plots.
- Compared categorical data with box plots, violin plots, count plots, and bar charts.
- Examined correlations and clusters using heatmaps and cluster maps.

## Skills Learned
- Data handling with **Pandas**
- Data visualization with **Seaborn & Matplotlib**
- Understanding numeric and categorical relationships
- Plot customization with titles, labels, and color palettes
- Correlation and clustering analysis

{## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
   Go to the folder where your Python file is located:
   cd C:\Users\ABCD\OneDrive\Desktop\numpy
   Run the project:
   python seaborn_project.py}



(You can change the folder path if needed but for now this is correct.)
